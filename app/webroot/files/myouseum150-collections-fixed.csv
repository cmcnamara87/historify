While some males will choose to roost alone, a colony will often average around 30 bats, with the largest colonies growing to around 200.

Gould's Wattled Bats are as common in wooded areas as they are in urban settings, and are frequently seen at dusk, flying around dams and other watering holes. While some males will choose to roost alone, a colony will often average around 30 bats, with the largest colonies growing to around 200. Interestingly, the female of the species can store fertile sperm for at least 33 days, allowing conception long after mating has occurred.

They usually have a cream or whitish shell and red or pale orange tentacles. Some species, like this one, swim actively by beating their tentacles while rhythmically opening and closing both shell valves. Undoubtedly, this helps them evade certain predators. Other species remain fixed to rocks or coral by organic fibres (byssal threads) produced by the animal. File clams filter-feed on plankton.

Gould's Wattled Bats are as common in wooded areas as they are in urban settings, and are frequently seen at dusk, flying around dams and other watering holes. While some males will choose to roost alone, a colony will often average around 30 bats, with the largest colonies growing to around 200. Interestingly, the female of the species can store fertile sperm for at least 33 days, allowing conception long after mating has occurred.

Redclaw are either male or female but it is not uncommon to find a specimen with both male and female genitalia. Because of the stable temperature of their tropical water environment, Redclaw breed all year round.
