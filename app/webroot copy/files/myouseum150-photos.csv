It occurs in open forest and woodlands from southern Queensland to Victoria. Bull ants have extremely keen vision, massive jaws and an extremely potent, painful sting, making them formidable hunters.

The winged adults are able to fly off at night in search of a new home if their pools begin to dry up. Following a record wet season in 2010 and 2011, populations of the Three-punctured Diving Beetle exploded in Queensland.

They impale their prey with their large curved jaws, injecting powerful saliva to liquefy their prey's internal tissues and suck them dry. As gruesome as this sounds, it gets worse.

Other species remain fixed to rocks or coral by organic fibres (byssal threads) produced by the animal. File clams filter-feed on plankton.

Commonly found embedded in heads of massive coral, the Christmas Tree Worm secretes a substance that forms a tube around its body.

To find a host, the tick climbs through leaves and shrubbery searching for a prime position, ready to latch on as soon as a host comes into reach.  Males rarely feed on a host, preferring instead to drink directly from a female.  While the saliva of a Paralysis Tick contains an anti-coagulant, it also contains toxins that have the capacity to paralyse and ultimately kill its host.  Native animals, such as koalas and echidnas, have become immune to these toxins.",,ixodes_holocyclus_og946_jw.jpg,111,Brisbane Tube Spider,Arbanitis longipes,"The Brisbane Trapdoor is a ground hunting spider that lives in earth burrows most commonly along embankments where there is little leaf litter.

Instead, their entrance is  lined with dead leaves bound with silk and completely open.

This cheliped is used by males in courtship rituals to attract females and signify their intent to competitors.  To eat, they move their smaller claw from ground to mouth across the cheliped.  This action appears like they are playing their large claw like a violin or fiddle, hence the common name 'fiddler crab'.

Males intercept flying females, grapple them to the ground and attempt to mate. During mating, which can last from 17 to 30 hours, the male secretes a plug around the female's genital opening, which later hardens into the insect equivalent of a chastity belt.

This sea was home to marine reptiles, turtles, sharks, squid and bivalves such as these.

The flour made from these seeds was a nutritious, high-energy food that was of vital importance in regions where other more easily processed plant foods were not readily available.
