Historify is an application that allows users to search, view and curate historical stories using digitised newspaper articles served by the Trove API. Inspired by the popular Storify which looks at curating social media to tell a story, we allow users to curate historical newspaper articles from the National Library of Australia and share them with others.

Historify makes use of a timeline to allow users to see when articles were published in relation to others so that they can draw relationships between one another. Along with chronological information for relating articles geographical information can also be used to relate articles drawn from a map of Australia.

We use a standard web technology stack (HTML, CSS and Javascript) with a PHP/MySQL backend to run the application. We use a number of client-side frameworks (Angular.JS, Twitter Bootstrap, Google Maps, CHAP Link Timeline), and CakePHP as a way to serve the Trove dataset.
